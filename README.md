## Getting Started

Welcome to my VS Code Tic-Tac-Toe Java project. This is a simple game, player vs player mode only, that helped me to understand the basics of JavaFX.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
